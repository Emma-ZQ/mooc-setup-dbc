# How to download the `.dbc` file for a lab - don't be tricked!

**Be sure to download the _raw_ archive.  Github will happily serve you a file with a `.dbc` extension which is simply an HTML page describing the file, if you download in the wrong place.**

The right method is to first left-click on the lab you want, then click on "**View Raw**" to download the actual file.
