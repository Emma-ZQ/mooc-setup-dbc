# mooc-setup-dbc
This repository has lab assignments for Databricks users (dbc format) for the two courses [Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark | edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-big-data-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs100-1x) and [Scalable Machine Learning | edX](https://www.edx.org/course/scalable-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs190-1x).

If you have a Databricks account on mooc0*.cloud.databricks.com, your shard is all set up.  If you are running your own shard, information for setting it up for the course is in the dbc-mooc-setub.dbc here.

If you are using Jupyter/IPython via the standard course VM, see https://github.com/spark-mooc/mooc-setup instead.

# How to download the `.dbc` file for a lab - don't be tricked!

**Be sure to download the _raw_ archive.  Github will happily serve you a file with a `.dbc` extension which is simply an HTML page describing the file, if you download in the wrong place.**

The right method is to first click on the lab you want, and then click on either "**View Raw**" or the **Raw** button to download the actual file.
